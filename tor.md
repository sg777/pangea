Here we can see what it means to run bet over chips and ln tor nodes.

Using tor we can create a virtual host with an onion address which can provide anonymity in chaneel establishment and in making deposits and withdrawls of the CHIPS. You can find the guide to setup the chips and ln nodes using tor [here](https://github.com/chips-blockchain/lightning/blob/master/doc/TOR.md). 

As we know during the game ln payments happens from players to dealer to record the gaming events, for this to happen at the start of the game players requests dealer ln uri and to this uri players establish the ln channels. Here the catch is a channel can't established from a non-tor node to a tor node and vice-versa. We can't make one entity either the dealer or the player to enforce whether if the ln and chips payments happen over tor or not. For these reasons we made it configurable for both the players and dealers. What this mean is say if the dealer configures address type as torv3 in the dealer_config.json then when the dealer node gets started first it make sure its running chips and ln over tor and publish this info with the players. So at the player side before player joining the table it checks whether its tor configuration matches with the dealer and if not player drops connecting to that dealer.
